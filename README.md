# Loruki
*A website for a fake cloud hosting service provider company*

## Description
This project is a simple and responsive website for a made up cloud hosting service provider company called Loruki.
It was built based up on a tutorial at [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia) youtube channel. 
It consists of three pages which are all responsive and built using modern CSS concepts like flexbox, grid and custom properties.

You can follow along  [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0bGHP-PXD4) and recreate a similar website. 
I have made some changes to some elements and implimented some things differently from how they are made in the origional tutorial.
